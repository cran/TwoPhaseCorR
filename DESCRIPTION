Description: Tools for constructing and analyzing two-phase experimental designs under correlated error structures. Version 1.1.0 includes improved efficiency factor classification with tolerance control, updated plot visualizations, and improved clarity of the results. The conceptual framework and the term two-phase were introduced by McIntyre (1955) <doi:10.2307/3001770>).
