# TwoPhaseCorR 1.1.0

## New Features
* Added tolerance-based classification for Efficiency Factor (E â‰ˆ 1).
* `eff_plot` now includes improved axis labels and enhanced visual clarity.
* Displays Efficiency Factor (E) at the specified `rho` directly in the console.

## Enhancements
* Cleaned output structure for improved interpretation and modularity.
* Support for discovering efficient designs across values of `v` and `rho`.

## Existing Functionality
* Constructs and analyzes two-phase experimental designs with correlated errors.
* Computes Efficiency Factor (E) across a range of intra-block correlation values.
* Includes plots for Efficiency Factor and design layouts for treatment effects.
